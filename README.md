# Medicube_Kotlin
2nd year 2nd semester MAD Project - Medicube_Kotlin

Our project “MediCude” is a mobile application that has the main goal of overcoming the issues faced due to the lack of medicines in the country. Our mobile application provides an interface for both users who are looking for medicine, and users from overseas who are looking forward to helping these patients to interconnect. In our research, we found that most overseas Sri Lankans and others are eager to help patients who are suffering from the lack of medicine in the country.  From this solution, the government can save the money they have to spend on medicine, and on any other essential tasks. <br/><br/><br/>
Anyone with a smartphone can use this application by creating an account. Patients can enter their required medicines along with the quantities to the Need Medicine feed and donors can enter the medicines they have with quantities and with their contact information to the Available Medicine feed. So that patients can contact donors when they found their required medicine in the Available Medicine feed. Also, the pharmacies in the country can sign up with this app and enter their available medicine stocks and regularly update the stock details.<br/><br/><br/>
Our app has functionalities to show the total quantity required, available quantity, and required quantity for every medicine (specifically essential medicine) using graphs. For all these, we should have the help of relevant government authorities such as the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) and the Ministry of Health. We aim to modify this app as a service to help with medicine-related censuses.
These are the 4 main functionalities we are going to implement in our project.<br/><br/>
